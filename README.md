Dataset: https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/fuels-price-survey-information/resource/15b54ed9-f711-45c8-bd87-30eb626f7c0a

## Overview of the analysis
1.  Using jupyter notebook to open and read csv files. 
2.  Using python language coding to extract data.
3.  Clean dataset by deleting excess columns to highlight key elements.
4.  Export clean dataset into new csv and excel files.
5.  Save new cleaned dataset files. 

## Purpose and Analysis
    Data cleaning in Python is essential for ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of data, which enables effective data analysis and modeling.
 
## Results

    Data cleaning is a process that removes errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information from datasets, resulting in clean and consistent data that improves the quality of data, produces more accurate analysis results, and is easier to explore and visualize. This process involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, detecting and correcting errors, standardizing data, and improving data quality. The benefits of data cleaning include improved data reliability, accurate analysis results, and easier data exploration and visualization, which ultimately leads to better decision-making and more successful outcomes.

## Summary

Using Python in jupyter notebook to clean datasets by removing excess data and columns. Transposing columns into rows. Clean data shows the major cities in Ontario, fuel rates and type from March 2020 - March 2023.
