## Overview of the analysis
1.  Using jupyter notebook to open and read csv files. 
2.  Using python language coding to extract data.
3.  Clean dataset by deleting excess columns to highlight key elements.
4.  Export clean dataset into new csv and excel files.
5.  Save new cleaned dataset files. 

## Purpose and Analysis
  Data cleaning in Python is essential for ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of data, which enables effective data analysis and modeling.
 
## Results

1.  Clean and consistent data: After data cleaning, datasets should be free of errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information. This makes it easier to work with the data and draw accurate conclusions.
2.  Improved data quality: Data cleaning can improve the quality of data by removing outliers, handling missing values, and standardizing the format.
3.  More accurate analysis results: Clean data produces more accurate analysis results, which can help inform decision-making.
4.  Easier data exploration: Clean data is easier to explore and visualize, which can help identify trends, patterns, and insights.
5.  Improved data reliability: Clean data is more reliable because it is less likely to contain errors or inconsistencies that could affect the accuracy of analysis results.

## Summary

Using Python in jupyter notebook to clean datasets by removing excess data and columns. Transposing columns into rows. Clean data shows the major cities in Ontario, fuel rates and type from March 2020 - March 2023.
